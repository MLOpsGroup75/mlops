# Docker Compose Build Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Problem**
`docker compose up` build was failing with build context issues.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
**Build Context Mismatch**: The Dockerfiles were trying to copy shared code using relative paths like `../services/common/`, but the build context in `docker-compose.yml` was limited to individual service directories (`./services/api`, `./services/predict`), which didn't include the parent directories with shared code.

```yaml
# BEFORE (broken):
api:
  build:
    context: ./services/api          # Limited context
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

The Dockerfiles were trying to:
```dockerfile
# This failed because ../services/common/ wasn't in the build context
COPY ../services/common/ services/common/
COPY ../config/ config/
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Changed Build Context to Root Directory**
```yaml
# AFTER (fixed):
api:
  build:
    context: .                       # Root context includes everything
    dockerfile: ./services/api/Dockerfile
predict:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: ./services/predict/Dockerfile
```

### 2. **Updated Dockerfile Paths**
Since the build context is now the root directory, all copy paths were updated:

```dockerfile
# API Service Dockerfile - BEFORE:
COPY requirements.txt .
COPY ../services/common/ services/common/
COPY ../config/ config/
COPY app/ services/api/app/

# API Service Dockerfile - AFTER:
COPY services/api/requirements.txt .
COPY services/common/ services/common/
COPY config/ config/
COPY services/api/app/ services/api/app/
```

### 3. **Fixed Command Paths in docker-compose.yml**
Updated the startup commands to use the correct module paths:

```yaml
# BEFORE:
command: python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# AFTER:
command: python -m uvicorn services.api.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## 🎯 **Results**

✅ **Build Success**: Both API and Predict services build without errors
✅ **Shared Dependencies**: All services can access `services/common/` and `config/`
✅ **Health Checks Pass**: Both services respond correctly on their health endpoints
✅ **Complete Stack Works**: Full docker-compose stack starts successfully

## 🚀 **Verification**

```bash
# All these commands now work:
docker compose build --no-cache     # ✅ Builds successfully
docker compose up -d                # ✅ Starts all services
curl http://localhost:8000/health    # ✅ {"status":"OK","service":"api"}
curl http://localhost:8001/health    # ✅ {"status":"OK","service":"predict"}
```

## 📋 **Key Learning**

The **build context** in Docker determines what files are available during the build process. When using shared code across services:

- **Root context (`.`)**: Gives access to the entire project structure
- **Service context (`./services/api`)**: Only gives access to that specific directory

For microservices with shared dependencies, using **root context with specific dockerfile paths** is the optimal approach.

## 🔧 **Architecture Benefit**

This fix maintains the clean separation of services while ensuring they can all access shared code:

```
mlops/                           # ← Build context
├── services/
│   ├── common/                  # ← Shared by all services
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── Dockerfile           # ← Can access ../common/
│   │   └── app/
│   └── predict/
│       ├── Dockerfile           # ← Can access ../common/
│       └── app/
├── config/                      # ← Shared configuration
└── docker-compose.yml           # ← Builds from root context
```

**Result**: Clean microservices architecture with proper code sharing! 🎉
